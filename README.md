# A sneaker website that fetches sneakers from an external api and displays them.

The sneaker website is built using contextApi.

The sneaker can be categorized as either males, females or both.

Bookmarks component will be made available where users can bookmark specific sneakers and it will be persisted to local storage.

Searchig for sneakers will also be made available.

The project will be on hold pending the time i upgrade to a premium version of the API or perhaps get another API as i am currently out of quota with the one i am currently using :(
